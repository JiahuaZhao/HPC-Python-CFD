Unloading /usr/local/share/epcc-module/epcc-module-loader

Warning: Unloading the epcc-setup-env module will stop many
modules being available on the system. If you do this by
accident, you can recover the situation with the command:

	module load /work/y07/shared/archer2-modules/modulefiles-cse/epcc-setup-env
